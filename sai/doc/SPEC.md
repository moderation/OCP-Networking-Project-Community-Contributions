# Introduction
This specification defines an abstraction interface for switching ASICs. The interface is designed to provide a vendor-independent way of controlling switching entities like hardware ASIC’s or NPU’s in a uniform manner. This specification also allows exposing vendor-specific functionality and extensions to existing features.

# Intended Audience
This document is intended primarily for the programmers who plan to use SAI API or develop SAI extensions.

# Definitions
**Adapter** is a pluggable code module, supplied by either a vendor or control plane stack owner, that contains either ASIC SDK code itself or client module for ASIC SDK hosted in external process and implements the interfaces described in this specification; for all practical purposes it is equivalent of a “user-mode driver”.

**Adapter host** is a Microsoft or vendor-supplied component that loads the adapter and exposes its functionality to the control plane stack. <sup>1</sup>

**Control Plane stack** is a set of software components that interacts with Adapter Host and provides higher level programming support to network control applications.

**Switching Entity** is an instance of a switching object; it represents a physical ASIC or software switch.

[1] While design and API’s of the adapter host are outside of the scope of this spec, some interactions with adapter host are covered in this document.

# High-Level design notes

Switching adapters are user-mode drivers, typically supplied by ASIC vendors. Adapters are registered with the switching stack and then can be loaded as needed. It is a responsibility of the adapter to discover and bind to the specified underlying hardware, including loading of or attaching to kernel-mode drivers if needed.

Adapters are expected to be as simple as possible, ideally simple wrappers around vendor’s SDKs. Our design strives to push the bookkeeping complexity from adapter into the adapter host wherever possible.

The adapter module is loaded into a hosting process (“adapter host”) and then initialized. During initialization the adapter initiates discovery process of the specified instance of a switching entity. A switching entity is a top-level object in this API.

There cloud be multiple Adapter Hosts running at the same time. Each Adapter Host is responsible for managing a portion of functions within the ASIC. For example, an IP routing Adapter Host is responsible for syncing IP routes to the ASIC, while a counter Adapter Host is responsible for reading counters from the ASIC.

Key assumptions, design decisions and API semantic clarifications:
* CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) based API to manage the sai objects.
* Adapter is not the source of the critical persisted state. It can crash or be shut down and the above stack will be able to recover from such an event.
* Due to resiliency requirements, the adapter host manages exactly one instance of a switching entity. Therefore “switch instance id” that comes from SDK is contained in the adapter code and doesn’t percolate into SAI API’s.
* If specific attributes are required for element creation, but not specified as part of the create function, the default value from either the container element or the top-level switching entity is used.
* Deletion of an object that is referenced should fail (e.g. removal of router when interface exist).

# API description
Proposed interface is a local interface between the Adapter Host and Adapter. ASIC functionality is exposed to the rest of the system by the Adapter Host through other mechanisms, which are not part of this specification.

The API is designed to be platform-agnostic (* nix/ Windows/etc...).

The API is attribute-based to minimize compatibility issues with versioning of structures and to allow API extensibility.

The API is a collection of C-style interfaces exposed from the adapter. These interfaces are grouped into three categories:
* Mandatory functionality. This is a set of “core” interfaces which are required to build a basic routing appliance. All vendors must support these interfaces and the switching stack will fail loading of the adapter if any of these interfaces are missing.
* Optional functionality. This is a set of additional interfaces which are not required, but enable various scenarios in a modern datacenter. Definition of these interfaces is common for all the vendors. These interfaces are not required by the switching stack to be exposed from the adapter. However, they become required if a given system configuration references any of these features.
* Custom functionality. This is a set of interfaces that are unique for a vendor and is not standardized. The default adapter host is not aware of these interfaces and a custom adapter host can be supplied by the vendor to expose these interfaces to the switching stack. _We also intend to propose a more generic framework for exposing such functionality through default supplied adapter host in further drafts._

Interfaces are discovered by querying for method tables through the mechanism described in the [Functionality query](#functionality-query-saih) section.

A near-future version of this specification will provide a mechanism for extending the functionality of mandatory and optional interfaces though custom attributes definition.

# Adapter startup/shutdown sequence

Adapter Host is provided with the information about binary module with adapter code that must be loaded during startup.

After adapter module load, adapter host acquires addresses of the three well-known functions: `sai_api_initialize()`, `sai_api_query()` and `sai_api_uninitialize()`.

After that `sai_api_initialize()` is called. Function is supplied with method table of services provided by the adapter host to adapter module. Note: SDK initialization should NOT be performed here. This function is just to take care of any platform-specific differences related to module loading, and generally should be very simple. After initialization, `sai_api_query()` can be used for retrieval of various methods tables for SAI functionalities.

Support for functionality versioning: if either signature or semantics of any function of a method table changes, new `sai_api_id` must be introduced (e.g. `SAI_API_VLAN2`). Adapter Host starts inquiry of functionality method table from the highest version that is known to Adapter Host. If newer API is not available, Adapter Host is free to fallback to any earlier or the first version. If the first version of the mandatory functionality category is not available, Adapter Host fails the adapter startup process.

Once all mandatory functionalities are successfully queried, optional functionalities are requested. Failure to discover optional functionality does not lead to a failure of the system startup.

After all the functionalities being retrieved, Adapter Host proceeds to exercising `SAI_API_SWITCH` functionality.

For example, first method that Adapter Host calls is `sai_initialize_switch()` that performs full SDK initialization. In a system where there are multiple Adapter Hosts, only one of them calls the above function. Others will call `sai_connect_switch()` to connect to the SDK once the SDK has been initialized. The call to `sai_connect_switch()` will fail if the SDK hasn’t been initialized. The `sai_intialize_switch()` function takes the following parameters:

* handle to a switch entity profile
* hardware id of that switch entity
* name of corresponding microcode
* callbacks table

The `profile_id` is used by the adapter to retrieve a profile which is a list of key-value string pairs that contain vendor-defined settings. Once the adapter has the profile id, it can use the function `profile_get_value()` and `profile_get_next_value()` from `service_method_table_t` to get the key-value string pairs, such as the `SDK_LIBRARY_PATH`, `NPU_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`. The `service_method_table_t` is provided by the adapter host during `sai_api_intialize()`.

Format and contents of the “hardware id” string is defined by the vendor and contains enough information to identify the device. For example it can contain PCIe location.

Name of the microcode is a vendor-defined string if vendor allows loading of a different microcode module during startup. It can be either path to a module, or a name of a module, or something else. We may consider introducing having mandatory key in the profile (e.g. “microcode”).

The function needs to discover the instance of the ASIC chip using “hardware id” string, map devices registers, query information to determine specific silicon revision, and given the microcode and the profile settings, initialize the SDK.

After this, driver enters normal operations and starts to handle calls from Adapter Host to various methods of different functionality tables. It is important to note that:  
During shutdown, Adapter Host will invoke `sai_switch_shutdown()` as a counter-party for the `initialize_switch()` to perform SDK de-initialization. For Adapter Hosts which uses `sai_connect_switch()`, they will use `sai_disconnect_switch()` to disconnect from the SDK.

`sai_api_uninitialize()` does the cleanup of anything that was done in `sai_api_initialize()` and is a last call to the adapter before it’s unloading.

Finally, Adapter Host unloads the adapter module.

# Data Types (saitypes.h)

File contains cross-platform definitions for data types used in SAI.
* Defines cross-platform `sai_ip_address_t` as union of ipv4 and ipv6 addresses.
* Defines cross-platform `sai_ip_prefix_t` as union of ipv4 and ipv4 prefixes.
* The `sai_mac_t` is defined as `uint8_t[6]` in network order with `mac[0]` to be the first byte of the mac address.
* `sai_attribute_value_t` is the value of all sai attributes. It is defined as a union of all base sai types defined in this header file. `sai_uint64_t` u64 defined in the `sai_attribute_value_t` is used for all sai attribute values whose base type is `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t` and `uint64_t`, whereas `sai_int64_t s64` is used for all values whose base type is `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t` and `int64_t`.

# Status codes (saistatus.h)
List of status codes returned from the SAI methods.

A number of attributes can be passed to the `create_sai_object` function where `sai_object` can be any sai object such as router interface, next hop. In case the create function call fails due to attribute related errors such as invalid attribute, invalid attribute value, unsupported attribute, and unimplemented attribute, saistatus.h allows the return code to convey which attribute causes the error. The saistatus.h defines a base index and maximum index for all these four types of attribute related errors. When you get an error code that falls into their defined ranges, the offset from its corresponding base index denotes that attribute that causes the failure. For example, if you pass 5 attributes into a `create_sai_object` call, and the return code (rc) is 0x00010003. You can first use `SAI_STATUS_IS_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE(rc)` to determine if the error is due to invalid attribute or not. In this case, the answer is yes. Then, you can subtract the return code with `SAI_STATUS_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_0` to get the offset. In this case, you will get 3 meaning the 4th attribute in the call is an invalid attribute.

# Functionality query (sai.h)

**Mandatory**. Switch adapter entry point for interface retrieval. If a signature or semantics of any method of an interface changes, new `sai_api_t` needs to be introduced, e.g. `SAI_API_VLAN2`. Adapter must also expose previous versions (at least the first version) of the interface to allow interoperability with older Adapter Hosts. The Adapter Host will always query an interface starting with the highest version that it knows about, falling back to previous version(s). If the first version of a mandatory interface is not available, Adapter Host fails the startup.

Adapter must keep track of which versions adapter host is using in order to be able to update the capabilities of the top-level Switching Entity.

# Switch functionality (saiswitch.h)

**Mandatory**. This is a top-level object exposed from the adapter. This switch object controls the switch level behavior such as cut-through or store-forward, ecmp hash configuration.

# Port functionality (saiport.h)
**Mandatory**. Implements physical port state manipulation as well as state (UP/DOWN) notifications. In the near future, it will also manage the port breakout mode.

# Forwarding Database (MAC Table) functionality (saifdb.h)
**Mandatory**. Implements FDB entries manipulation as well as aging/learning notifications.

# VLAN functionality (saivlan.h)
**Mandatory**. Implements VLAN management functions, such as add/remove port from a vlan.

# Router functionality (sairouter.h)
**Mandatory**. Implements functions to manage virtual routers, such as creating and deleting virtual routers.

# Router Interface functionality (sairouterintf.h)

**Mandatory**. Implements “router interface” object. The router interface is attached a specific virtual router. It can be either VLAN-based or port-based router interface. You can also specify source mac address for the router interface. However, if the ASIC does not support per-router interface source mac address, the source mac address will inherit from the source mac address from higher hierarchy such as virtual router or switch object.

# Route functionality (sairoute.h)
**Mandatory**. Implements IP routing table (FIB) management functions. When an IP packet is received, the ASIC first determines if the packet is destined a certain router interface on the switch. If yes, then the ASIC lookups its destination IP address in the IP routing table, and forwards the packet to a next hop or a next hop group using ECMP.

# Neighbor functionality (saineighbor.h)

**Mandatory**. Implements the IP neighbor table management functions. IP neighbor defines a L3 neighbor that is within the same IP subnet as one of the router interface on the router. The IP neighbor is associated with a specific router interface, is assigned to a specific IP address, and has a mac address. IP neighbor also has a packet action attribute to decide whether to forward, drop or trap the IP packet which comes from a different router interface with destination IP matching the neighbor IP. The IP neighbor does not define the outgoing port as this can be resolved using the FDB table.

# Next Hop functionality (sainexthop.h)

**Mandatory**. Implements next hop objects such as IP next hop and IP tunnel next hop. Current version only has IP next hop defined. IP next hop must also be an IP neighbor. It defines an IP neighbor that a packet can be routed to. The user needs to create an IP neighbor before it creates an IP next hop. The sai associates them using the router interface ID and the IP address. The IP next hop is identified by a next hop ID which can be used in sai_route as well as other matching rules to forward traffic to an IP prefix to it. Intuitively, IP neighbor represents a device without any packet forwarding capability so that only traffic destined to its IP are forwarded to it, whereas IP next hop represents a device that can also forward other traffic. IP next hop is associated with a specific router interface, and is identified with an IP address.

# Next Hop Group functionality (sainexthopgroup.h)

**Mandatory**. Implements next hop group functions. A router can have many next hops. In case of unicast, a packet can be spreaded among a group of next hops using ECMP. Next hop group contains a group of next hops.

# ACL functionality (saiacl.h)

**Mandatory**. Implements generalized Access Control Lists management functions. The ACL contains three types of objects, ACL table, ACL entry and ACL counter. The ACL table contains a number of ACL entries. Each ACL table defines a set of unique matching fields for all its ACL entries. A packet can match rules in different ACL tables and take non-conflicting actions from all the matched rules. However, within an ACL table, if a packet matches multiple rules, only the actions from the rule of highest priority are executed. ACL counters can also be created and attached to an ACL entry in order to counter the number of packets or bytes that match the ACL entry.

# Quality of Service functionality (saiqos.h)

**Optional**. Implements QoS functions. Manages the port scheduling mechanisms and CoS mapping.
